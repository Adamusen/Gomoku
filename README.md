# JavaGomoku

This is a simple Gomoku game I used to write for one of my Java classes. The code is well commented and readable. The GUI of the application is quite simple, this particular assigment was done to demonstrate the capability of network connections and communications via Java. You can download the .jar file and the two little pictures of X and O to try out the game.
